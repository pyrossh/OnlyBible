			<p>
				This app was created by us, to be a minimally invasive bible app as I got tired and fed up
				with the current trend of bible apps in the app stores. Most of these apps try to upsell
				various materials of the bible. Now days they are also into the subscription business model
				else trying to get Ad revenue. This is all fueled more by the book publishers who make
				profits from the original Bible manuscripts by translating them and selling it instead of
				giving it for free.
			</p>
			<p>
				All the bibles used in this App are free and available in the public domain. Most of the
				text are sourced from
				<a href="https://www.wordproject.org/" target="_blank">The Word Project</a>
				and compilation work done by the
				<a href="https://github.com/godlytalias/Bible-Database" target="_blank">
					Bible Database team
				</a>
