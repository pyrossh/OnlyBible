	<p>
		By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply to you – you should make
		sure therefore that you read them carefully before using the app. You’re not allowed to copy or
		modify the app, any part of the app, or our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt
		to extract the source code of the app, and you also shouldn’t try to translate the app into
		other languages or make derivative versions. The app itself, and all the trademarks, copyright,
		database rights, and other intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to us.
	</p>
	<p>
		We are committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as possible. For that
		reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any
		time and for any reason. We will never charge you for the app or its services without making it
		very clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.
	</p>
	<p>
		The Only Bible App app stores and processes personal data that you have provided to us, to
		provide my Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure. We
		therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of
		removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your
		device. It could make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise
		your phone’s security features and it could mean that the Only Bible App app won’t work properly
		or at all.
