This app was created by me; Peter John, to be a minimally invasive Bible App as I got tired and fed up with the current trend
of bible apps in the App Stores. Most of these apps try to upsell various materials of the bible. Now days they
are also into the subscription business model else trying to get Ad revenue. This is all fueled more by the book publishers
who make huge profits from the original Bible manuscripts by translating them and selling it instead of giving it for free.

> And said unto them, It is written, My house shall be called the house of prayer; but ye have made it a den of thieves.
> Matthew 21:13

The word was given freely to all and is expected to be free even after processing/translation. But they have made it a
marketplace to take our God's word and make it den of thieves.

All the bibles used in this App are free and available in the public domain. Most of the text are sourced from
[The Word Project](https://www.wordproject.org/) and compilation work done by the [Bible Database](https://github.com/godlytalias/Bible-Database) team.

I also agree to and completely follow the [Copyrights Statement](https://www.wordproject.org/contact/new/copyrights.htm) of the Word project.
